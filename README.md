This repository is for practicing the Git-Hub Flow.
I'm from the Metro Detroit area. I recieved my Bachelors in Business Administration from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, and after graduation I worked as a Financial Analyst in the automotive industry. I'm excited to pivot in my career and excel in my technical skillset!
